abstract: |
  <p>
  Real-time planning for a combined problem of target assignment and path planning for multiple agents, also known as the unlabeled version of multi-agent path finding (MAPF), is crucial for high-level coordination in multi-agent systems, such as pattern formation by robot swarms.
  This paper studies two aspects of <span class="text-danger">unlabeled-MAPF</span>:
  (1) offline scenario:~solving large instances using centralized approaches with a small computation time, and
  (2) online scenario:~executing unlabeled-MAPF, despite the timing uncertainties real robots face.
  For this purpose, we propose <span class="text-danger">TSWAP</span>, a novel sub-optimal complete algorithm that takes an arbitrary initial target assignment and then repeats one-timestep path planning with target swapping.
  TSWAP can adapt to both offline and online scenarios.
  We empirically demonstrate that <em>offline TSWAP</em> is highly scalable, and provides near-optimal solutions while reducing runtime by orders of magnitude compared with existing approaches.
  In addition, we present the benefits of <em>online TSWAP</em>, such as delay tolerance, through real-robot demonstrations.
